# CodeSignalChallenge
This is where I store my own solution to coding challenge problems in CodeSignal, written either in C or other languages.
Since new challenges become more and more difficult as moving on to the next, I think posting in GitHub is a good way to celebrate and keep the solution each time I solve a new problem.
